# CompanyList
Create a Company and list all your staffs within the categories: executive, senior management, staff, and intern.

Purpose of App: To create companies and to add employees within each company. 
Why the creation of this app: To utilize CoreData in my app.  

NOTE: ALL DONE PROGRAMMATICALLY.
NOTE: Done in UITableViewController

-------------- What I learned and Implemented -----------------  

1. Creating multiple Entities: Company, Employee, EmployeeInformation. 
2. Learned how to create and connect a 1 to 1 relationship between class objects. 
3. Learned how to create a context with persistant container. 
4. Learned how to insert newObjects into that particular entity.
5. Learned how to fetch each objects. 
5. Learned how to use NSBatchedDeleteRequest, to delete existing objects and permanently removing them from container/context. 
6. Learned how to uniquely identify each section for that company. 
7. Used the class DateFormatter to format into string "MM/dd/yyyy" upon creation of a company or employee.
8. Learned how to migrate, lightweight and custom. (NOTE: Haven't implemented entirely, but just to learn) 
9. Using navigationBar throughout the application. And to note repeat my code, have implemented it in appDelegate to persist throughout each controller or upon creation of a new controller that needs a navigationBar with item/items.
10. IDK OTHER STUFF.
